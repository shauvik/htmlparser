<body bgcolor="white">
The sax package implements a SAX (Simple API for XML) parser for HTML.
It uses the SAX 2 interfaces available from the <A
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sax/">sax</A> project.<br>
The HTML parser sax package is currently in it's infancy and just exposes the DOM Parser
via a SAX interface. The driver name is "org.htmlparser.sax.XMLReader" and a
simplistic test program is available in the org.htmlparser.tests package as
SAXTest.java.<br>
Some major pieces are missing, like namespace support (HTML files won't
generally have much in the way of namespaces), attribute type info, resolvers
and DTD handlers, among many other things.<br>
